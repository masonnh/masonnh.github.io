                                Installing a tile shower can be a great way to add both style and function to your bathroom. As a business, we understand the importance of providing high-quality work at an affordable price. That's why we take pride in our ability to install tile showers that not only look great but are also built to last. Now, let's see what to expect when you hire us for your tile shower installation project.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted">
                                The first step in installing a tile shower is to schedule a consultation with our team. During this consultation, we'll discuss your design preferences and the specific needs of your bathroom. We'll also take accurate measurements of your bathroom and provide you with a detailed estimate for the project. This will give you an idea of the cost and timeline for the project before we move forward.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted">
                                Once the design is finalized, our team will begin the process of preparing the area for the new shower installation. This may involve tearing out old tile, removing a bathtub, or making other necessary repairs. Once the area is prepped, we will then install the shower pan, it's a waterproof base that sits under the tile and is essential for keeping water from leaking into the subfloor.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted">
                                Next, our team will begin the process of laying out the tile on the shower pan and the walls, starting from the bottom and working up. This process is called dry-fitting the tile and allows us to adjust the layout and make any necessary cuts before the tile is actually installed. Once the layout is finalized, the tile is then adhered to the shower pan and walls using thinset mortar.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted">
                                After the tile has been installed, our team will then grout the joints between the tiles. Grout is a cement-based material that is used to fill the gaps between the tiles and provide a finished look. Once the grout is dry, the surface is cleaned and sealed to protect the tile and grout from water and stains.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-muted">
